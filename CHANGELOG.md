## [0.1.2] - 2025-05-26

### Changed
- Changed all function arguments, variable names, and docstrings from `top_k` to `k` for clarity and consistency.
- `compare()` no longer requires the `vector_size` parameter. Vector dimensionality is now inferred from the `query_vector`.
- Candidate vectors are automatically validated against the inferred size.
- Removed the method parameter from the main similarity function (was previously intended for future extensibility).
- Renamed the main function from compare to cosine for clarity.
- Updated all internal imports, tests, and benchmarks to use cosine.
- API: The main similarity function is now cosine_similarity (was previously compare/cosine).
- File Structure: Renamed cosine.py to cosine_similarity.py for clarity.
- Tests: All tests now use cosine_similarity as the entry point.
- Public Interface: Only cosine_similarity is exposed in the packageâ€™s public API.
- Improved Rust cosine similarity kernel by moving the division for query_norm out of the hot loop. Now precomputes the reciprocal of query_norm and uses multiplication inside the scoring loop, reducing the number of divisions and improving throughput for large candidate sets.
- Improved Python wrapper for `cosine_similarity` that adds explicit check for empty `candidate_vectors` to provide a clear error message. 
- Now checks that all candidate vectors have the correct dimension.
- Pre-allocates the batch buffer for better performance during batch processing.
- Refactored `speed_comparisons_batch.py` benchmark script to standardized batch processing logic across all benchmark functions

### Fixed
- Improved API clarity and reduced confusion by making the cosine similarity function explicit.

### Removed
- The `vector_size` argument from `compare()` and `_prepare_vector()`. This change simplifies the API and reduces the risk of mismatched vector sizes.
- The method parameter from the Python API.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-05-23

### Added
- Added `ci-check.yml` GitHub Actions workflow to validate wheel and sdist builds for all supported platforms and Python versions without uploading to PyPI. This workflow helps ensure all artifacts are correct before release.

### Fixed
- Updated CI workflow to use `--interpreter python` in maturin build arguments, ensuring each job builds only for its matrix Python version and preventing wheel overwriting during artifact merging.
- Fixed CI workflow for Linux wheels to use the correct Python interpreter path inside the manylinux container, ensuring successful builds for all targeted Python versions.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-23

### Added
- Initial implementation of high-performance brute-force cosine similarity search with a Rust backend and Python bindings via PyO3.
- `cosine_similarity()` function exposed to Python: computes cosine similarity between a query vector and multiple candidate vectors and returns the top-k most similar candidates.
- SIMD-accelerated (wide::f32x8) routines for dot product and norm calculations to maximize performance on modern CPUs.
- Adaptive parallel scoring of candidate vectors using Rayon for efficient multi-threaded computation.
- Inline, heap-based top-k selection algorithm for efficient retrieval of the k most similar candidates.
- Strict validation of C-contiguous memory layout for all vector inputs to ensure optimal performance.
- Python compare() interface: simple, type-safe wrapper that allows direct vector comparison and batching from Python.
- Utility functions for diagnostics (e.g., thread count, SIMD support) in the Rust backend.
- Benchmarks comparing package performance to NumPy and scikit-learn cosine similarity implementations.

### Fixed
- Fixed CI workflow to correctly merge all built wheel and sdist artifacts into the `dist/` directory before publishing to PyPI, preventing missing distribution errors.
